A mailbox app created with a group using GTmob (html, css, javascript, jquery mobile) at GT-RNOC at Georgia Tech and entered into the Convergence Innovation Competition (CIC) competition. The app allows students to register their mailbox information (i.e. number, combination) and choose notification settings for the presence of mail in their mailbox. With these notifications students will be able to see if they have a package and schedule when to pick up their mail. Settings include how often to be notified and whether by email, text, or both.
